Thanks
======

I want to shout out a huge »thank you« to all of you who have downloaded and installed my extension. It is nice to know that so many of you like and use my extensions and I am happy about all the feedback I receive from you guys out there – so thanks a million!

Another big »thank you« goes to the people supporting me with new ideas and with bug reports, I could not do this without the help of you, so I really thank these nice persons:

* Markus Dange who inspired me to create this extension and to publish it.

* Berthold Gies who suggested the sorting-features. Thank you!
