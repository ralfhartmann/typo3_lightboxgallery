Users Manual
============

To add an image lightbox to your page, first upload the images to a new folder through the filelist module in the Typo3 backend. I recommend placing all your gallery folders in the user_upload folder or one of it's subfolders.

After you uploaded the files, activate the page module and navigate to the page you want to add the lightbox to. Create a new content-element and choose the "Lightbox Gallery" from the Plug-Ins list.

Now switch to the plugin tab and, using the folder option, select the folder you just placed the images in. Save your changes and you are done, the lightbox should be placed in the frontend now.

Additionally, you can specify some options on the Plugin-tab, if you like, like for example how the images should be ordered. Have fun playing with this!
