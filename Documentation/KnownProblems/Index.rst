Known Problems
==============

The folder selection in Typo3 is broken again in Typo3 6.2. So I switched back to file selection. As a temporary fix for that problem, you now have to select one image in the wanted folder. You do not have to select all images, the plugin will still scan the whole folder.

If you find some bugs, errors or similar, mail me at info@advitum.de!
